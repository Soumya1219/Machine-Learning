###  Embedding layer enables us to convert each word into a fixed length vector of defined size. Keras provides an embedding layer that converts each word into a fixed-length vector of defined size. The one-hot-encoding technique generates a large sparse matrix to represent a single word, whereas, in embedding layers, every word has a real-valued vector of fixed length.
